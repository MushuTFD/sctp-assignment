Succinctly explain what is Cloud Architecture Design - Operational Excellence?

strategic planning and implementation of practices that streamline and enhance the day-to-day management and operation of a cloud computing environment. It focuses on optimizing processes, improving efficiency, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Key elements include the automation of routine tasks, the implementation of robust monitoring and alerting systems, and the development of well-documented procedures. Operational Excellence also emphasizes resource optimization, cost management, and the use of best practices for security, reliability, and performance. The goal is to establish a framework that enables teams to efficiently operate and manage cloud-based systems, respond effectively to incidents, and continually refine processes for better overall performance and business outcomes.
