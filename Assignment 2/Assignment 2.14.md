Succinctly explain what is Cloud Architecture Design - Cost Optimization?

Cost Optimization involves strategically planning and configuring a cloud computing environment to maximize operational efficiency and minimize expenses. It encompasses practices that aim to achieve the desired level of performance and reliability while optimizing resource utilization and controlling costs. Key aspects include selecting the right-sized and cost-effective cloud services, implementing auto-scaling to adapt to variable workloads, and leveraging pricing models such as reserved instances or spot instances. Continuous monitoring, analysis of usage patterns, and regular adjustments to resource allocations help ensure that the infrastructure aligns with business needs while avoiding unnecessary expenses. The goal is to achieve the best possible performance at the lowest cost, allowing organizations to benefit from the flexibility and scalability of cloud services while maintaining financial efficiency.

Choose your own system, then succinctly explain how would you implement Cloud Architecture Design - Cost Optimization on your system.

- Analyze application performance and adjust the size of EC2 instance based on actual resource requirements, using the most cost-effective instance types.
- Implement Auto scailing to dynamically adjust the number of instance based on demand, scaling up and down during different period.
- Set up monitoring tools to track resource usage, application performance and cost metrics.
- Using  AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and others to offload operational overhead and reduce the need for maintaining and managing infrastructure.
