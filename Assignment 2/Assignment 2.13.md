# Assignment 2.13

Succinctly explain what is Cloud Architecture Design - Performance?

It is the planning and optimization of a cloud computing environment to ensure efficient and responsive system behavior. Deisning systems that deliver optimal speed, through put and resource utilisation. 

Performance-oriented cloud architectures often involve load balancing, auto-scaling, and content delivery networks to distribute workloads and reduce latency. Continuous monitoring and tuning are essential to identify bottlenecks, analyze resource usage, and make adjustments for sustained high performance.

Choose your own system, then succinctly explain how would you implement Cloud Architecture Design - Performance on your system.

- Selecting the right EC2 instance based on computational needs and optimize the instance configurations, including CPU, memory and storage
- Implement auto scaling group to adjust the number of instances based on demand and ensuring optimal resource utilization depending on workloads.
- Implementing ALB to distribute incoming traffic evenly across multiple EC2 instance.
- Optimize database performance using Amazon RDS and enabling read replicas for read-heacy workloads.
- Set up monitoring tools on instance to track key performance metrics.
- Using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeDeploy to automate code deloyment to ensure rapid and realiable releases without performance degradation.
